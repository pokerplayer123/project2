# project2
Pears has been built using node.js and JavaScript; Meteor Framework was used to developed both backend and frontend and enables the app to be run at localhost, eliminating the need to be hosted by an external server. 

Backend: - Developed using node.js and native JavaScript with MongoDB as the software 
Frontend: - Developed using Meteor native framework, jQuery and Lodash for JavaScript.

Materialize CSS Framework (http://materializecss.com/) was incorporated within frontend development to make the UI look modern, minimalistic, follow Google’s Material Design principles and optimise the apps for mobiles and tablet screens. 

Github was used to store and share the database, enabling the developers to work simultaneously and keep track of each other’s progress.
